    <p>ZIG & SHARKO is about a hyena named Zig who lives on a volcano island with his crab pal, Bernie, and plots against a beautiful mermaid, Marina, whom he wants to eat. Through a series of schemes and elaborate inventions, Zig attempts to snatch Marina from her ocean rock perch, but he's always thwarted by Marina's protector, Sharko. At times other sea dwellers make attempts as well, including the self-absorbed King Neptune, who hopes to win the affections of the beautiful mermaid.</p>
